For this project I shall be analyzing signatures of selection in genome wide selection scans of *Anopheles gambiae* phased haplotype data to find genes that are associated with insecticide resistance. 

The data for this project comes from the MalariaGEN Vector Observatory. They offer a curated collection of SNP, CNV, and phased haplotype data on *Anopheles gambiae/colluzzi/arabiensis* and other mosquito species from various African countries. The data, accessible via the MalariaGEN API, is publicly available but requires registration through their Google form: https://forms.gle/kCqistorZyxaU4LP7

 I'll perform genome-wide scans of selection on all chromosomes for samples from Eastern Uganda in 2019. I'll generate H12 plots to show peaks where genomic loci are undergoing hard/soft sweeps. Then, I'll examine the loci under selection to identify genes associated with insecticide resistance.
